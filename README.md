# Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio page. It has a header with my name and links to the three sections underneath. After the header section is a section that contains a picture of me and a subtitle for the page with a background behind it. Underneath is a section that describes me. After that section is a section that contains cards with previews to my projects. My first project is a bigger size than my other projects. When hovering over these cards there will be effects on the card that show that the cards is the image being focused on. If you click any of these cards they will take you to the deployed github pages links of the projects. There are 2 placeholder cards for now as I do not have enough projects to fill the section. The last section is a contact me section with a dummy phone number, my email, and my github page. This webpage also responds to the browsers size and different dimensions for other devices. It will look different on smaller screens like tablets and even smaller screens like mobile phones.
